      <p>
        Hi, I&apos;m Gilan. I am a full-stack software engineer continuing my
        learning of web development with Python and JavaScript via Hack
        Reactorâ€™s software engineering boot camp. I have enjoyed working with
        other technologies such as Arduino, programmable logic controllers,
        Autodesk I have 3 years of work experience as an electrical engineer in
        the MEP industry, where I spent time creating designs for residential
        and commercial buildings, performing electrical and fire alarm
        inspections, and commissioning critical systems. I am now looking
        forward to continuing me career as a software engineer and an expert in
        Web 2.0 technology in order to segue into Web 3.0, where I believe
        cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and blockchain technology will drastically
        change the world as we know it.
